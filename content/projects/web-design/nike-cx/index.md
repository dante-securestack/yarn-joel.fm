## Nike CX Blog / Next.js & Emotion Demo

After months of harping my colleagues about Next.js and Emotion with limited success, understanding the difficulty of motivating a group of developers to change a working formula, I realized that talk only goes so far: *let's see it*. So I developed this [Next.js application](https://csx-js.vercel.app) in hopes of exhibiting the full capabilities and dramatic performance enhancements of [Emotion](https://emotion.sh), emphasizing the vastly improved developer experience, and, ultimately, the benefit to the user's experience, and used it as a reference point in delivering a CSS-in-JS presentation to my colleagues, managers, and directors.

<p>This site features server-side-rendering (SSR), on-the-fly image optimization, and responsive styling with Emotion. It achieves Google Lighthouse scores as follows:</p>
