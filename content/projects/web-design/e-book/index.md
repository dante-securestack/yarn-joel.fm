## Interactive E-book

A minimal ‘proof-of-concept’ design for an entirely new interactive ebook platform designed to engage readers by enhancing the narrative with interactive elements such as character illustrations/biographies, responsive/3D location maps, and other audio/visual elements.

> The framework will include a simplified JSON data-schema to structure multimedia content. The JSON data object containing author’s text, links to various media, and other content would then be parsed by a client-side function flowing the content responsively according to the reader’s device.

> Portable networked devices are designed for user-interaction; this platform would enable an indie author to embellish their narrative with meaningful exposition and visual elements without delineating from the story while a biology textbook could capture students with an interactive video or image gallery of the subject.
