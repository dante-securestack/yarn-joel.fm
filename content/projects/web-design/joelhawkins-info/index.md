## joelhawkins.info

My (first) personal & professional website showcasing my portfolio, experience, skills, interests, projects, and contact information. The current design utilizes Bootstrap along with some customized JS libraries. Ongoing design since 2014.

My website is an ongoing project which I frequently restyle & refactor to exercise the latest design tools.
