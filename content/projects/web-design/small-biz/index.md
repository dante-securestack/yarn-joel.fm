## Small Business WordPress Theme

I developed this theme for a client who found that the theme they purchased did not meet all of their requirements. I recreated the theme to match their requirements. I went beyond their demands and included extensive customizability from the customizer panel so that the user, or website administrator, would not have to touch any code. What is shown here is a slightly modified version which obscures information about the client.

One of the greatest challenges was to integrate a new WordPress “widget” into the theme, seen in the demo video below as Service Widgets. Since the client worked in marketing, I included a number of different “calls to action” and easily accessible contact information.

> The terms of our agreement prevent me from displaying a live version of this theme, however I have provided a video to demonstrate the basic functionality.

<video class='center-text' style='max-width: 100%;' autoplay loop class='fluid-width-video-wrapper'>
      <source src='./small-biz-video.mp4' type="video/mp4" />
</video>
