jpng.info–<span class='italic'>j––– portable network graphics</span>; the website showcases some of my digital multi-media artwork which explores the interaction between Internet technology and contemporary design, marketing, and media production to highlight the lurid, often peculiar visual methods employed to appeal to consumers. Ongoing project since 2014.

<blockquote>I exploit the mediums of digital collage, HTML, CSS, social media, and code to render these forms with beauty and meaning.</blockquote>
