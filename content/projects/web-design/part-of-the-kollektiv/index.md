## Part of the Kollektiv

A website designed for Portland, OR based musicians known at the time as Part of the Kollektiv. My earliest commissioned work which integrates Songkick, YouTube, and Bandcamp APIs.

> This design is entirely hand-coded with no CSS/JS library dependencies. It emulates the look and responsive nature of Bootstrap without the extraneous features (and data-size).
