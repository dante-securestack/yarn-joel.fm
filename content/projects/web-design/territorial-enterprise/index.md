## Territorial Enterprise

I developed this entirely custom website redesign for the historic publication, *The Territorial Enterprise*. In its day, *Territorial Enterprise* featured many early works by Mark Twain, Lucius Beebe, and more. Commissioned by owner and author Tom Muzzio, the design evokes the familiar style of an antique newspaper updated with a clean, modern look that prioritizes readability.

> Hand written in HTML5/CSS with Bootstrap CSS and JS plugins, custom JavaScript/jQuery for Facebook API integration and customized JS-powered table-of-contents to navigate authorâ€™s works. Also managed the Facebook / social media campaigns to promote publications.
