## React Task Manager Webapp
### built with React.js

I made a *super* fun React Task Manager App to further familiarize myself with the latest version of Facebook’s JavaScript user interface library, React.js–and because the world was *begging* for another task management app. You can add, delete, and search tasks at lightning speed. You can also change the way tasks are sorted; sort by name, date, or owner, and choose to view them in ascending or descending order.

Designed purely as a lightweight demo which utilizes the core features of React.js such as the virtual DOM, object properties, property types, and component states. It also makes use of React sub-components. I’m continuously working to expand my knowledge and fluency in React as well as related technologies. Look forward to more projects on [joel.fm](https://joel.fm/) in the future!
